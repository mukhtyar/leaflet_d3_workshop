###Start a local server

This exercise covers the basics for starting a local server.
Although you can just open your HTML file in any browser and view it, when you are loading external data sources it is more reliable to run a local server and view your page from http://localhost:8000.
There are many different ways of setting up a local server depending on what operating system you use. Here's a very simple one that works on Windows machines in this lab.

###Steps

1. Open a terminal window. Change directory to the workshop folder. Start a local server using Python.

    ```
    >cd \Documents\leaflet_d3_workshop\exercises
    >C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.3\python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```

2. Open Chrome browser. Type `localhost:8000` into the url bar at top. You should see a web page with links to all the html files for difference exercies. Use the GitHub repo for instructions. 

3. You will be working in three windows
 
* HTML file open in a Chrome browser tab
* GitHub repo open in a Chrome brwoser tab
* Javascript file open in a code editor, e.g. Sublime Text
